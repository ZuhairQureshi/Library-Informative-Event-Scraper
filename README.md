This project is a service that scrapes the Toronto Public Library Programs listing webpage for all events in the upcoming week. It creates a PDF containing all of this information and emails it to specified end users, as displayed below.

This project is extremely useful for people looking to make more social connections, learn new skills, or even discover new library branches. 

The service can be improved by:
* integrating a user interface that allows users to specify filters (i.e. genre of event, age category, branch)
* incorporating location information to order display of branches on the catalogue based on nearness

For now, all source code is contained in main.py.
